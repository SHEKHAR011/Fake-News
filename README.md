# Fake News Detector App

This is a React Native application that uses AI to detect fake news. Simply paste a news article and get an instant analysis of its credibility.

## Features

- Real-time fake news detection using Gemini AI
- Color-coded results (green for real, red for fake, orange for uncertain)
- Chat-style interface for easy interaction
- History of previous analyses
- Secure API key management
- Input validation and error handling

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up your Gemini API key

   Create a `.env` file at the project root (copy `.env.example`) and add your Gemini API key:

   ```properties
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

   You can get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

## Technical Improvements

This project includes several technical improvements:

1. **Security**: API keys are stored in app.json configuration, not in source code
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for API calls and user input
3. **Performance**: 
   - React.memo for optimized component rendering
   - AsyncStorage for message persistence
4. **Code Quality**: 
   - TypeScript types for better code reliability
   - Constants for consistent styling and values
   - Input validation for user-submitted content
5. **User Experience**:
   - Persistent chat history
   - Clear error messages
   - Responsive design
